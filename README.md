# Disco Byngo
> Play music bingo with your friends using your own Spotify Playlists

This is my first somewhat larger project. Disco Byngo allows you to play musical bingo with your friends using your very own Spotify Playlists.
It requires you to log into Spotify using OAuth2.0 and gives you access to all your personal playlists and playlists saved. It is a work-in-progress sideproject, so you you might stumble upon some bugs.
